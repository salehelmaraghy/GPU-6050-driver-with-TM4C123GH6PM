# GPU-6050-driver-with-TM4C123GH6PM
This project is to use the GPU6050 (accelerometer and gyroscope) with TIVA-C (TM4C123GH6PM) using CMSIS and Tivaware.

To use this project to need to:
1-use GNU compiler with CCS.
2-Use the startup file and linkerscript that I have provided with the code.
3-include the CMSIS files to the compiler directories.
4-Include the Tivaware (driverlib) to use the functions of FPU.
